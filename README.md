# JMV

My first ever github repository!

JMV is a Java Model Viewer (it's not JVM, but JMV) which relies on LWJGL 3.3.3 and ImGui 1.86 by @SpaiR. So basically, JMV is a program which will prompt the user to select a file name among a list (this list actually represents obj files stored within the workspace). Once the user clicks on one of those, the model they asked for will be rendered to the screen. The user will then be able to move the camera around, rotate it along the x, y and z-axis and same for the model using the GUI or preset key bindings. So far, that's what it will do: Render 3D models and allow the user to move them around.

Hope you'll enjoy!
